I never understood why there isn't an incentive to sustain your Life and Mana in Terraria, so I made this.

Remember: Agony hardens the Heart. Comfort softens it.

**What this does**
Your Stats can now be increased/decreased through certain means. See below.

Stat Exercise:
-Receiving damage that is greater than or equal to a quarter of your Max Life will increase Max Life by 3 and Max Mana by 2. This has no limit. As long as the damage dealt is a quarter or more of what you can handle, you will grow stronger. (configurable)

Stat Degradation:
-Both stats decrease by 1 point every 3 minutes. (configurable)


Additionally, this mod adds recipes for Life Crystals, Mana Crystals and Life Fruits. (configurable)
